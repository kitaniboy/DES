# Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)

This repository provides a simple implementation of AES using python and numpy. This implementation is as explained in the textbook [Understanding Cryptography](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-04101-3) by Christof Paar & Jan Pelzl. It should be noted that this implementation was created for learning purposes. For security usage, well-established packages should be used.

## Examples

```Python
print('hello world')
```
